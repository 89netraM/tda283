Project Overview
================

These pages describe the project for the Compiler Construction course
at Chalmers and Gothenburg University. The project has three parts:
(Part A) a fronend for the Javalette language, (Part B) a backend with
code generation for LLVM and (Part C) extensions to the compiler.

The project is to be done in individually or in groups of two. A
group's final grade is based on the number of extensions completed for
Part C of the course.

Collaboration and academic honesty
----------------------------------

As mentioned above, students word individually or in groups of two on
this project. Students must develop their own code, and are *not*
allowed to share code with other students or to get, or even look at,
code developed by others. Having said that, we do encourage
discussions among participants in the course about the project at a
conceptual level, as long as everyone follows the simple and absolute
rule _to not share code_.

Students who get significant help from others must make a note of this
and acknowledge (in their documentation file) those who helped.

Don't be a cheater.
